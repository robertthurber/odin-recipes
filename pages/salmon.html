    <h1>The best recipe for citrus roasted salmon</h1>
    <img src="../images/salmon.jpeg" alt="A picture of Citrus Roasted Salmon in the pan">
    <h2>Here is a list for all of the ingredients you are going to need</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li>4 oranges</li>
        <li>3 limes</li>
        <li>1 (3-lb.) skin-on salmon fillet, pin bones removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh dill, divided</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      
    <h2>Now to the direction</h2>
    <div class="direction">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 400°F. Slice 1 orange and 1 lime into 1/4-inch thick
          rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place salmon, skin side down, on a parchment-lined rack set inside a
          rimmed baking sheet. Brush salmon with melted butter. Sprinkle with 1
          1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper. Cover loosely
          with aluminum foil. Roast in preheated oven 25 minutes. Uncover and
          arrange citrus slices over salmon in an artful pattern. Return salmon to
          oven, and roast at 400°F until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, juice remaining oranges and limes (making 1 1/4 cups juice).
          Strain juice into a stainless-steel saucepan. Bring to a boil over
          medium-high, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until reduced to about
          2/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cubed butter, 2
          tablespoons of the dill, and remaining salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place salmon on a platter; sprinkle with remaining dill. Serve with
          sauce.
        </li>
      </ol>
