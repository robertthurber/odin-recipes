    <h2>Now to the Direction</h2>
    <div class="direction">
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire,
          garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended.
          Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty
          about 4 inches
        </li>
        <li>
          Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or
          high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2
          to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until
          browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8
          minutes total. Remove from grill.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30
          seconds to 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato,
          burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Some special chief notes</h2>
    <div class="credit">
      <p>
        If you want absolute bacteria safety, you need to cook your burgers to
        160°. This recipe will keep them moist.
